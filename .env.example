# Supabase Configuration
# Get these values from your Supabase project dashboard at https://supabase.com/dashboard

# Your Supabase project URL (found in Settings > API)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co

# Your Supabase anon/public key (found in Settings > API)
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials
# 3. Restart your development server after making changes

# IMPORTANT: For password reset to work properly in production:
# 1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
# 2. Navigate to Authentication > URL Configuration
# 3. Add your deployed site URL (e.g., https://your-site.netlify.app) to the "Site URL" field
# 4. Add your deployed site URL to the "Redirect URLs" list
# 5. For development, also add "http://localhost:5173" to both fields
# 6. Save the settings

# For CORS settings:
# 1. Go to Settings > API
# 2. Add both your deployed URL and "http://localhost:5173" to CORS allowed origins
# 3. Save and restart your dev server

# Troubleshooting Connection Issues:
# If you see "socket hang up" or connection errors:
# 1. Verify your Supabase project is active and accessible
# 2. Check your internet connection
# 3. Add your development URL (http://localhost:5173) to Supabase CORS settings:
#    - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API
#    - Add "http://localhost:5173" to allowed origins
#    - Save and restart your dev server
# 4. Ensure your Supabase URL and API key are correct
# 5. Try accessing your Supabase URL directly in a browser to test connectivity

# Troubleshooting 403 Authentication Errors:
# If you see "403 Forbidden" errors during login/logout:
# 1. Double-check your VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY matches the anon key in Supabase dashboard
# 2. Verify CORS settings include your development URL
# 3. Ensure your Supabase project is not paused or deleted
# 4. Check that you're using the anon key, not the service_role key for client-side auth
