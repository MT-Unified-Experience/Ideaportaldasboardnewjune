I can see how this can be helpful. A work-around was developed for my company. In my weekly push-approved spreadsheet, the approvers comments are now included. The approver(s) has a way to note the invoice allocation (which is not always a matter allocation) in the comments line of their approval. This is now a new column in my push-approved report which gets the attention of my AP Dept on how to allocate by invoice. It is a helpful and efficient new feature for us. Thank you."

ACU-I-57,Expand Matter Auto Generate Naming Conventions,Shipped,3,0,Zoemy Soto (zoemy.soto@aah.org),2025-01-13 15:12:57,Matter Management,Zoemy Soto,"1. We are considering the year the matter is being opened. Rather than having it as part of the matter name, does Acuity have the capability to autogenerate the matter year in the matter number when a matter gets created or does the year need to be part of our naming convention? For example: YYYY.HRO.#####. We would imagine this is possible since Acuity is able to put a prefix for the matter number such as HRO, LIT, CORP.
2. Is there a logic behind the autogenerated numbers in a matter number? For example, some matter numbers may have either a 1,2,3 or 4-digit number following the practice area in the matter number (i.e. HRO.1, HRO.12, HRO123, HR.1234). When we are pulling reports and sorting it is not really sorting from minimum to maximum. Is there a format we can ask to stick with when we autogenerate these numbers? What happens when we finish all 4 digits? Will it than move to 5 digits? Would it be possible to commit to an x number of digits that there is no possible way we'll be able to reach so at least we maintain the number of digits consistently so that when we sort something that is easily sorted. For example, if we commit to 6-digits, can we pad 0's at the front (i.e. HRO.000123).
3. What are the character limits when creating new matter names?",I believe other clients who use the matter auto generation may like to have more flexibility in how to format their Matter Numbers.,This request was brought up with Case No. 2024-1211-8456422,"Currently the client is putting the matter year in the Matter Name. Additionally, report sorting is problematic due to the matter numbers not following the same exact digits","",Low - nice to have,Client,"","Tonia Freeman Jan 15, 2025

Hi - this is extremely disappointing that we cannot use a firm's entire address. As a matter management tool, this is crucial.

If I asked someone to provide me with all the firms I have engaged in the UK, no one could provide that data. Seems highly inefficient and useless. I strongly suggest fixing this problem. This is not an ask for a new idea. We are asking Mitratech to fix a problem that we cannot see the firm's full address profile.

Thank you for the consideration.

Hi - ESAB continues to receive requests from our accrual recipients to include each firm's users to receive the accrual notification. These notices often do not trickle down from the Firm's POC to the billing team end users. Forwarding these monthly notifications manually on my part defeats the purpose of the automated workstream.

Client opens Matter X

On April 20th Client assigns firm Jones, Day to the matter. Mr. Jones' hourly rate is $500 an hour.

Client ""freezes"" or ""locks"" Mr. Jones' hourly rate for Matter X at $500 an hour.

The matter goes on for three years. During that time, Mr. Jones' default rate increases to $750 an hour then to $1,000 an hour.

However, on Matter X, Mr. Jones is still only allowed to bill $500 an hour per the original assignment date.


System Enhancement -

In 3.5 clients had a ""Freeze Rate"" option on the Firm Settings. (screenshot attached)

In 4.X we would add an option on Firm Settings so that by matter and by firm, client could select to enforce the rates that were in effect on the firm's assignment date, regardless of subsequent rate increases.

During implementation, Client would select what the default setting should be - Freeze rates, or Use Default Rates based on Rate Effective Dates.","This improvement would benefit all clients. Currently, BCG has asked for this (in implementation).
