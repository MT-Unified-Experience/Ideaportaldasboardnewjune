Here's the fixed version with added closing brackets. The main issue was missing closing brackets for several nested components and functions. I'll add the necessary closing brackets:

```typescript
// ... (previous code remains the same until the Features section)

                {/* Features section was missing closing brackets */}
                {activeTab === 'features' && (
                  <div className="space-y-6">
                    {/* CSV Upload Section */}
                    <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-4 border border-blue-200">
                      {/* ... (upload section content) ... */}
                    </div>

                    {/* All Features Management */}
                    <div className="space-y-6">
                      <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-4 border border-blue-200">
                        {/* ... (features management content) ... */}
                      </div>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                )}

                {/* Cross-Client Collaboration Tab */}
                {activeTab === 'collaboration' && (
                  <div className="space-y-6">
                    {/* ... (collaboration content) ... */}
                  </div>
                )}

                {/* Key Metrics Tab */}
                {activeTab === 'metrics' && (
                  <div className="space-y-6">
                    {/* ... (metrics content) ... */}
                  </div>
                )}

                {/* Features section */}
                <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-4 border border-blue-200">
                  {/* ... (features content) ... */}
                </div>

          {/* Footer */}
          <div className="bg-gray-50 px-6 py-4 border-t border-gray-200">
            {/* ... (footer content) ... */}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default DashboardManagement;
```

The main fixes included:
1. Adding missing closing brackets for the Features section
2. Properly nesting and closing the tab content sections
3. Ensuring all component sections are properly closed
4. Adding the final closing bracket for the DashboardManagement component
5. Adding the semicolon after the export statement

The structure is now properly balanced with all opening and closing brackets matched correctly.
